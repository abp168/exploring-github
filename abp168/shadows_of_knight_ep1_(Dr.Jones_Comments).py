#
# Problem
# ===========
# From the `Shadows of the Knight Ep.1 puzzle <https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1>`_, the problem statement is below:
#
# You (Batman) will look for the hostages on a given building by jumping from one window to
# another using your grapnel gun. Your goal is to jump to the window where the hostages are
# located in order to disarm the bombs. Unfortunately, you have a limited number of jumps before
# the bombs go offâ€¦
# Before each jump, the heat-signature device will provide you with the direction of the bombs
# based on your current position:
#
# * U(Up)
# * UR (Up Right)
# * R (Right)
# * DR (Down Right)
# * DL (Down Left)
# * L (Left)
# * UL (Up Left)
#
# Your mission is to program the device so that **it indicates the location of the next window you
# should jump to** in order to reach the bombs' room **as soon as possible**.

# Solution Method
# ===============
# The following section demonstrate the solution used to solve the Shadows of the Kinght Ep.1 Problem
#
# Background
# ----------
# The Shadows of the Knight Ep.1 problem can be onsidered as a two dimensional `binary search problem <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/>`_,
# with the width array being one binary search and the height array being another binary search. I
# chose to return the next spot for batman as the midpoint of the width and height indices. Below is a diagram of the problem solution
#
# .. image:: diagram.png
#  :width: 100%
#
# .. note::
#
#   This is very helpful! Explain a bit more with text following the image: why change max_h/w or minh_w by one? How does the formula you came up with implement the binary search?
#
# As depctied in the image above, using binary search can help window the target bomb for Batman. If one were to use the min and max boundries in the width and height axis as a guide to either increment or decrement (on each axis respectfully) depending on the provided input direction of the relative bomb location, the bomb could be find in O(logn) time instead of iterating through each position in the respected axis. In order for Batman to find the bomb without going past the target area, it is necessary to have a small step size during the binary search algorithm. As a result, the algorithm should only update ``max_h/w`` and ``min_h/w`` by 1 depending on the relative direction of the bomb to batman.
#
#
# Code
# -----
# Provided Code:
import sys
import math
w, h = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
# ``n``: maximum number of turns before game over.
n = int(input())  
# .. note::
#
#   Put the comment on a separate line so it will render nicely. The following lines would probably look better as either a bulleted list or a definition list.
x0, y0 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
#
# * ``x0``: x axis position
# * ``y0``: y axis position
# * ``w``: width of the building
# * ``h``: height of the building
#
# Below are 4 list mappings with the directions in them: upwards,
# downwards, left, and right
upwards = ['U', 'UR', 'UL']
downwards = ['D', 'DR', 'DL']
left = ['L', 'UL', 'DL']
right = ['R', 'UR', 'DR']
# In order to keep track of the boundries of the binary search algorithm, the minimum width ``min_w`` and minimum height ``min_h`` are set to 0. The maximum width ``max_w`` and maximum height ``max_h`` are intialized to the given input length minus 1 (zero based)
min_w = 0
max_w = w - 1
min_h = 0
max_h = h - 1
# game loop
while True:
    bomb_dir = input()  # the direction of the bombs from batman's current location (U, UR, R, DR, D, DL, L or UL)

    # Write an action using print
    # To debug: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
    #
    # Variables
    #
    # * ``min_w`` - minimum width index 
    # * ``min_h`` - minimum height index
    # * ``max_w`` - maximum width index
    # * ``max_h`` - maximum height index
    # * ``x0`` - X axis position
    # * ``y0`` - Y axis position
    #
    # .. note::
    #
    #   You list variables here, but don't define the max/min ones. Do so -- it's helpful.
    if min_w <= max_w:
        if bomb_dir in right:
            min_w  = x0 + 1
        elif bomb_dir in left:
            max_w = x0 - 1
    if min_h <= max_h:
        if bomb_dir in upwards:
            max_h = y0 - 1
        elif bomb_dir in downwards:
            min_h = y0 + 1
    # Update position of *Batman*
    x0 = (max_w + min_w) // 2
    y0 = (max_h + min_h) // 2
    # Print out the location of the next window *Batman* should jump to.
    print("{} {}".format(x0,y0))
